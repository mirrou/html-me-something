            <p id= "intro"> Several years ago my husband (Ryan) and I moved back to Missouri from Southern California, where I had gone to college.
                We loved it there but after having our son, Rami, we decided it would be nice to bring him closer to family.  Of course we told ourselves
                we'd visit often.  Fast-forward nine years, we now have two kiddos and we haven't managed to make it back to Cali once.
                Last summer we finally got our chance when our good friends were going out of town and needed housesitters for their
                house in Orange County.  We had just come into some vacation time.  The stars aligned and we found ourselves with free fantastic accomodations in SoCal.
                To make it even more of an adventure we decided to tack on a few days for travel and road-trip it out there.  I'm so
                glad we did!  Giving ourselves a little extra time turned the long commute into a vacation unto itself.
                Summer '16 was pretty sweet for our little family. </p>

                <p id= "intro">This is the story of our journey back to Cali....</p>

                            <p>Our trip begins in KC on the morning of July 3, 2016.  We packed ourselves up in the in-laws'
                            minivan and drove 9 hours to Denver, CO.  We were eager to see the mountains but unfortunately by the time
                        we arrived it was too dark.  The next morning, however we were greeted with some spectacular views and amazing
                        weather.

                        <p>The mountains were so beautiful in Denver, we decided we'd find a place to hike around on our way to
                        Grand Junction.  On our way out of town we stopped at the market and stocked up on picnic foods.  Then we hit the road in
                        search of a nice place to stop for lunch.  We found a lovely area by the river with shady grassy areas for a picnic and
                        trail and river access for hiking and exploring.  </p>

                            <p>We arrived in Las Vegas on the last night of Ramadan.  Since the following day was Eid we decided we'd
                                take a break from driving, stay another night and celebrate Eid in Vegas :)  With the temp reaching 109 degrees,
                                we mostly spent the day lounging by the pool and eating in fancy restaurants.  Once the blistering sun went down we took to the strip and did some sightseeing.
